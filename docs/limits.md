# Limits, gaps and test split

Moved out of the README (README canon, `repo-standards/STANDARDS.md` § README canon).

## Limits of the runner and CLI

- **The egress verdict is a source classification, not proof of anonymity.** The
  gate blocks LOCAL_ONLY / confidential / berufsgeheimnis / Art. 9 sources; a
  non-confidential PII document passes and its redacted overlay leaves. The gate
  leaves the overlay unscanned, so "cleared" stays short of a zero-residual
  certificate.
- **Overlapping findings no longer splice the overlay.** This entry used to say
  placeholder fragments were "a known redactor artefact" of overlapping
  findings. They were not cosmetic — a spliced replacement left un-redacted PII
  beside the fragment. Overlapping spans are merged into disjoint ones covering
  the union before anything is applied, in `redactor.py` and in
  `anonymous_json.py`, which had its own unfixed copy of the same loop.
- **Over-redaction of long digit runs is deliberate.** Card detection applies
  Luhn to every 13–19 digit window at every offset, with no issuer-prefix
  table, so a Luhn-valid window inside a longer digit run is redacted — on
  twenty realistic German business documents carrying no payment identifier,
  six were affected (tracking numbers, an IMEI, long internal references). An
  issuer table would cut that to one, at the price of a stale BIN range
  standing between a real card and the gate. IBAN detection is held to the
  ISO 13616 registered length per country and produced no false positives on
  the same corpus. A false positive can only consume digits and the joiners
  written inside a number, never prose. Measured by
  `tests/test_identifier_runs.py`.
  Admitting gaps wider than one character raised this from six to eight, and
  the hostile corpus from three to eight. The new shape is a window assembled
  across ONE separator out of two adjacent numbers in a list. Refusing it needs
  a condition on the candidate's edges, and every such condition tried refuses
  a real leak shape instead — text glued to both ends of a spaced number clips
  both edges, and `Art. 6 DSGVO4111 1111 1111 1111Ref ` then egresses the card
  whole. Fail-closed wins. Measured by
  `tests/test_identifier_runs.py::test_precision_under_deliberately_hostile_punctuation`
  and `::test_card_precision_on_clean_business_text`.
- **UUID fragments are over-redacted when they satisfy Luhn.** The tail of a
  UUID plus the first character of the next token can form fifteen Luhn-valid
  digits, and nothing in the text distinguishes that from a fifteen-digit card
  written with a hyphen and a space, so it is redacted.
- **What counts as one identifier, in one sentence:** *a candidate is any
  maximal sequence of ASCII alphanumerics joined by runs of characters that are
  not alphanumeric at all and not a line break, spanning at most sixteen times
  its own length, with no interior group longer than twelve where it covers
  three groups or more.* There is deliberately no bound on the NUMBER of
  groups: one was tried and it refused a letter-spaced form field, which is
  what `pdftotext` emits and which leaked a whole card number. Joiners
  are defined by exclusion rather than listed, and their WIDTH is unbounded,
  because three successive rules were walked around: the literal `" \t-"`, then
  the Unicode categories `Zs`/`Pd`/`Cf` (which miss `Pc` underscore and `Po`
  colon, dot, slash), then a hard limit of one joiner per gap (which a
  `pdftotext` column gap, fixed-width padding, a dot leader and a monospaced
  table all defeat). Only the interior groups are bounded, because only they
  are never clipped by the candidate's own edges and so are whole tokens — four
  digits in a real layout, thirteen in a list of article numbers. Tested:
  `tests/test_identifier_runs.py::test_every_joiner_category_groups_an_identifier`
  (joiners generated from `unicodedata`, not from a list),
  `::test_the_layout_bounds_reject_assembled_prose`,
  `tests/test_leak_invariant.py::test_a_multi_character_gap_does_not_hide_a_card`,
  `::test_reported_extraction_artefact_shapes`.
- **A line break is never a joiner**, so an identifier wrapped across two lines
  is not claimed. Making it one would glue a document's lines into a single run
  and let a column of figures be assembled into a checksum. A wrapped card is
  today redacted only incidentally, by the phone pattern catching its first
  half; the residue is pinned by
  `tests/test_leak_invariant.py::test_a_line_wrapped_identifier_is_a_known_gap`
  so that narrowing that pattern fails loudly instead of leaking quietly.
- **Person names are found by evidence, not by capitalisation.** German
  capitalises every noun, so "capitalised word followed by capitalised word"
  claimed 75% of every character of ordinary business documents containing no
  personal data — 121 spans across twenty documents, 90% on one memo. A name is
  now claimed only where a title, a signature block, an addressee position or a
  known given name says a person is being named. Measured on a development and
  a held-out corpus: false positives on clean documents went 73/48 spans to
  **0**, precision 24%/25% to **100%**, recall 86%/89% to **100%**.
  **Positions the name layer COVERS**, by name, because this is the list the
  release is shipping on: a salutation (`Sehr geehrte Frau Schneider`); after a
  title or address form (`Herr Dr. Baumann`, `von Herrn Stefan Braun`); the
  first name-shaped line after a closing formula; an addressee block above a
  street or postcode or below a bare `An`; a known German given name followed
  by a surname in running prose; a value after a label that names a person's
  role (`Sachbearbeiter:`, `Von:`, `An:`, `CC:`, `Im Auftrag von:`), including
  comma-separated lists; and a table cell whose column header names a person's
  role.

  **Positions it does NOT cover**, also by name: a bare surname in running
  prose with nothing around it; a speaker attribution (`Ebersbach: Der Termin
  …`); a line that is only a name outside a signature or address block (a bare
  participant list); a footnote citation (`Vgl. Kowalczyk, Gutachten …`); a
  bare given name on its own; and **any full name whose given name is not in
  the German given-name list** — `Aleksandra Nowakowska`, `Mateusz Wisniewski`
  and `Yuki Tanaka` are invisible in running prose. The speaker-attribution and
  name-only-line positions were measured and deliberately not shipped: they
  cost 1 and 17 false-positive spans on clean documents respectively.

  **The cost, re-measured against document classes specified from outside this
  work:** recall is **11 of 21** name occurrences (52%) on correspondence that is
  not a formal letter — nothing after a colon, in a CC list, in an e-mail body
  without a title, in a footnote, in minutes, in a table cell or in a subject
  line, and **nothing for a non-German full name in prose**, because the rule is
  gated on a German given-name list. The earlier claim that the cost was "a bare
  surname in running prose" named a corner; this is the class. Pinned by
  `tests/test_name_layer_precision.py::test_the_measured_recall_on_correspondence_that_is_not_a_formal_letter`.
  What each additional position would cost in precision is measured in that
  file's comment; none of it is shipped, because widening this rule is what
  produced 75% character loss and the choice belongs to the owner.
### The stoplist inversion — analysis for the next round, not shipped

A positive given-name list cannot close the gap above: it is unbounded and
multilingual, and no list of names is ever finished. The tractable form is the
inverse — claim a capitalised word pair *unless* its words are ordinary
vocabulary. `Ihr Schreiben` and `Interne Mitteilung` are in a dictionary;
`Nowakowska` is not, in any dictionary but Polish. Written down here so the
next round starts from this rather than rediscovering it:

- **Which list.** A German lemma-and-inflection frequency list, not a lemma
  list alone — German inflects, and `Schreibens` must match as readily as
  `Schreiben`. The DeReWo full-form frequency lists (IDS Mannheim, CC-BY-NC) or
  a Wiktionary-derived full-form list (CC-BY-SA) are the realistic candidates;
  licence matters here, because this package is Apache-2.0 and NC terms are not
  compatible with it.
- **What size.** Coverage of German business prose flattens around the top
  100k–200k full forms; below ~50k the tail of compounds starts leaking
  through as false names. Compressed, that is roughly 1–3 MB — an order of
  magnitude more than everything this package currently ships.
- **What it costs to ship.** A data file of that size cannot go in the wheel
  without changing what the package is; it needs an optional extra, a download
  step or a system dictionary, and each of those breaks the current property
  that the regex floor works with zero dependencies. That property is worth
  more than the recall, so the stoplist has to be optional and the floor has to
  stay correct without it.
- **How it degrades.** Badly on compound nouns, which German coins freely:
  `Foerderbandsteuerung` will not be in any list and reads as a surname.
  Badly on loanwords and product names (`Dockingstation`, `Nordstern`). And it
  is one list per language, so a document in a language with no list loaded
  degrades to the current behaviour rather than to nothing — which is the
  right failure direction, but means the gap above persists per-language.
- **What it does not fix.** A bare surname in prose is still ambiguous with a
  capitalised noun the list happens to be missing; the inversion raises recall
  and moves the false positives from "every capitalised pair" to "every
  capitalised pair the dictionary does not know", which is much smaller but not
  zero. It needs the same clean-corpus measurement before shipping.
- **The layout bound has a cliff at about eighty characters of gap.** An
  identifier whose groups are spaced further apart than that is not found.
  Sweeping the bound from 4x to 1000x the identifier length does not change the
  false-positive count at all, so it buys no precision; it is kept only to stop
  two numbers at opposite ends of a long line being assembled, and set where no
  real column reaches. Pinned by
  `tests/test_leak_invariant.py::test_the_span_bound_has_a_cliff_and_this_is_where_it_is`.
- **Single-character groups are accepted, so dotted prose is over-redacted.**
  "4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1" is what `pdftotext` emits for a
  letter-spaced form field, and "4.1.1.1..." is punctuated prose. Nothing in
  the text separates them, so both are redacted.
- **The IBAN country/length table is a transcription and cannot self-check.**
  ISO 13616 is amended about twice a year; the table was missing 40
  registrations including Honduras and Yemen, whose IBANs were therefore not
  IBANs to this package, with every test green.
  `tests/test_iban_registry.py` compares it against `schwifty`, a maintained
  external implementation, and fails on any drift. Without that dependency
  installed the check skips loudly rather than passing.
- **Detection is ASCII for the validated types.** Identifier runs are built
  from ASCII alphanumerics; an account number written in full-width or
  Arabic-Indic digits is not offered to the validators. Invisible characters
  (Unicode `Cf` — soft hyphen, zero-width space, BOM) are removed first and
  never break a run. ASCII is a FINDING rule and not a definition here:
  `luhn_ok` accepts Arabic-Indic and full-width digits that neither the
  detector nor the gate's oracle will ever offer it. Pinned by
  `tests/test_leak_invariant.py::test_non_ascii_digits_are_a_documented_limit_not_a_silent_one`.
- **Folder walk** defaults to known text/document extensions
  (`runner.DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS`); use `--all-files` to consider every file.
  Binary/undecodable files are recorded as per-document `errors`, not fatal.
- **Semantic and local-LLM passes are optional.** With neither the `[semantic]`
  extras nor a local model present, detection is the deterministic regex/lexicon
  floor only (the modules degrade gracefully). `[extract]` extras
  (PyMuPDF, which is AGPL, and opencv) are needed for PDF/image extraction; without them those
  documents surface an extraction error.
- **The semantic pass needs a LOCAL embedding endpoint.** `PIIContextMatcher`
  sends document chunks — raw, pre-redaction text — so it is held to the same
  loopback-or-unix-socket rule as the local-model send paths. Point
  `OPENAI_BASE_URL` at a local embedding server; against anything else the
  semantic layer declines, logs once, and the scan continues on the regex
  floor. The one-off `embed_pii_contexts()` setup is exempt: it embeds the
  fixed context phrases in the module's own source, not anybody's data.
- **The local-LLM layer talks to local HTTP endpoints.**
  `services/local_model_runtime.py` discovers providers on
  `http://localhost:11434` (Ollama), `:1234` (LM Studio), `:1337` (Jan) and
  `:4891` (GPT4All). Detection stays on the machine; it is local HTTP rather
  than an in-process model.
- **The MCP tool is the enriched path, not the only path.** `scan()` and the
  `privacy-shield` CLI are the callable capability with nothing else
  installed; the `privacy-shield` skill's `privacy_scan` tool requires
  `loomground-mcp`.

## Known gaps

The ONNX contextual model is shadow-only (no promotion); there is no bundled
pre-embedded PII-context file.

## Test split

```
python3 -m pytest -q
886 passed, 8 failed
```

894 tests collected (`pip install ".[dev,semantic,extract,openai]"`). The 8
failures are all in `tests/test_simplifier.py`'s LLM path, which patches
`privacy_shield.services.llm_runtime` — an upstream gateway this package does
not ship; they fail identically on the tip before this round's changes.
`openai` is installed here (and by CI's `tests` job) so
`tests/test_local_model_endpoint_guard.py`'s send-path assertions run rather
than skip.
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` deselects the 8 llm_runtime tests by name, so the
`tests` job runs 886 passed, 8 deselected.

The leak invariant is its own CI job that `tests` waits on:
`tests/test_leak_invariant.py`, 372 tests including a 300-document generated
battery in each of the four privacy modes and a hypothesis property run. With
`hypothesis` absent the property half is skipped and the rest still runs.

**What the gate costs: about 3 seconds**, with every extra installed as
CI now installs them. Measured with `--durations`: 3.0s total, of which the
property run is 0.7s and each 300-document battery is 0.25s. Its oracle is deliberately quadratic — every subsequence of alphanumerics
within 136 characters of each position — and that is still cheap, because the
documents are short.

If it ever appears to hang, delete `.hypothesis/`. A stale example database
replays previously-failing inputs and re-shrinks them, which turned this same
2.9s run into several minutes here more than once; that directory is generated,
is in `.gitignore`, and should never be carried between checkouts.

Every privacy-shield core test file passes: regex-only, embeddings, semantic
wiring, overlay, local-model runtime, config, onnx contextual PII, media inputs,
review profiles, the optional external-enforcement seam
(`tests/test_privacy_gate_external_enforcement.py`), and the runner + CLI on synthetic
PII fixtures (`tests/test_privacy_shield_runner.py`, 13 tests).
